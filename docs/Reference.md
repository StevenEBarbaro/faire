Tasks belong to a single tasklist. A tasklist can have many tasks. A tasklist has one owner and has many users that have shared access to it, which is called access_list. A tasklist can have an access status of public, private, and shared. Public means everyone can read but only the owner can write or delete. Private means only owner can read and write or delete. Shared means only the owner can dismiss a task, but all users in the access_list has read and write access and may mark a task as done but cannot dismiss a task.
